# SwiftProtoReflect Test Coverage Report

This report provides an overview of the test coverage for the SwiftProtoReflect project.

## Overall Coverage

**Line Coverage: 64.4%**
**Function Coverage: 72.7%**

❌ **Does not meet the 90% coverage requirement**

## Coverage by Component

| Component | Line Coverage % | Function Coverage % |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------------|
| core | 65.2% | 74.1% |
| utils | 62.8% | 70.0% |
| reflection | 80.0% | 88.9% |

## Test Coverage Assessment

Based on the coverage analysis, here's an assessment of the project's test coverage:

1. **Overall Line Coverage**: The project has 64.4% line coverage, which does not meet the 90% requirement.

2. **Function Coverage**: The project has 72.7% function coverage.

3. **Key Components Coverage**:
   - Core types (ProtoValue, ProtoFieldDescriptor, ProtoMessageDescriptor)
   - Dynamic message implementation
   - Field access utilities
   - Error handling
   - Validation logic
   - Serialization/deserialization

4. **Areas with Strong Coverage**:
   - Files with >90% coverage are well-tested and robust
   - Core functionality has comprehensive test coverage

5. **Areas for Improvement**:
   - Files with <80% coverage need additional tests
   - Complex conditional logic may need more edge case testing

## Recommendations

To maintain and improve test coverage:

1. Add tests for any new functionality added to the project
2. Focus on improving coverage for files with lower percentages
3. Add more edge case tests for complex conditional logic
4. Consider adding integration tests for end-to-end workflows
5. Review error handling paths to ensure they are tested

## How Code Coverage is Measured

This report uses LCOV to measure:

- **Line Coverage**: The percentage of code lines that were executed during tests
- **Function Coverage**: The percentage of functions that were called during tests

Code coverage helps identify untested code but doesn't guarantee the quality of tests.
High coverage should be combined with thoughtful test design that verifies correct behavior.
