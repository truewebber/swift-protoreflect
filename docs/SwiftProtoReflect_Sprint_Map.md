# SwiftProtoReflect Sprint Map

## Overview

This sprint map outlines the development plan for SwiftProtoReflect, a dynamic Protocol Buffer handling library for Swift. The library will be built directly on Apple's SwiftProtobuf library, extending it with dynamic capabilities rather than creating parallel implementations. This approach ensures seamless integration with the existing SwiftProtobuf ecosystem while adding valuable dynamic message handling capabilities.

## Risk Management Strategy

To proactively address potential risks identified in the Technical Roadmap, we will implement the following risk mitigation strategies throughout the development process:

| Risk | Mitigation Strategy | Implementation |
|------|---------------------|----------------|
| Performance overhead compared to direct SwiftProtobuf usage | Early and continuous performance benchmarking | Performance baseline in Sprint 1, optimization in Sprint 4 |
| SwiftProtobuf API changes | Monitoring releases and maintaining compatibility layer | Version monitoring task in each sprint |
| Memory leaks in complex scenarios | Memory profiling and leak detection in CI | Memory testing in Sprint 4 |
| API design limitations discovered late | Early prototyping and incremental API reviews | API review tasks in each sprint |
| Swift language evolution impacts | Monitoring Swift evolution proposals | Swift compatibility check in Sprint 5 |

## Conclusion

This sprint map provides a structured approach to developing SwiftProtoReflect as an extension to Apple's SwiftProtobuf library. By building directly on SwiftProtobuf rather than creating parallel implementations, we will deliver a high-quality, performant, and developer-friendly library for dynamic Protocol Buffer handling in Swift that integrates seamlessly with the existing SwiftProtobuf ecosystem. The library maintains a focused scope, concentrating on core dynamic message handling functionality without venturing into framework-specific integrations. This ensures that SwiftProtoReflect remains a solid foundation upon which other libraries and applications can build more specialized functionality.
