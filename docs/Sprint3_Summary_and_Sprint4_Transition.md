# Sprint 3 Summary and Sprint 4 Transition Plan

## Sprint 3 Achievements

Sprint 3 has successfully delivered the core wire format implementation for SwiftProtoReflect, including:

1. **Varint Encoding/Decoding**
   - Implemented complete varint encoding and decoding functionality
   - Added support for zigzag encoding for signed integers
   - Created comprehensive test suite for varint operations

2. **Wire Type Handling**
   - Implemented all required wire types (Varint, Fixed64, LengthDelimited, Fixed32)
   - Created mapping between Proto field types and wire types
   - Added validation for wire type compatibility

3. **Basic Serialization**
   - Implemented serialization for primitive types (int32, int64, uint32, uint64, bool)
   - Added support for repeated fields of primitive types
   - Created serialization context for managing buffer state

4. **Basic Deserialization**
   - Implemented deserialization for primitive types
   - Added support for repeated fields deserialization
   - Created error handling for malformed data

5. **Integration and Testing**
   - Integrated all components into a cohesive serialization/deserialization system
   - Created 245 tests covering the core functionality
   - Achieved 64.1% overall code coverage

## Remaining Tasks for Sprint 3

Before officially closing Sprint 3, the following tasks need to be completed:

1. **Improve Test Coverage**
   - Current coverage: 64.1% (target: 90%)
   - Focus areas:
     - `ProtoFieldType.swift` (26% coverage)
     - `ProtoFieldPath.swift` (38.5% coverage)
     - `ProtoFieldDescriptor.swift` (24.5% coverage)
     - `ProtoWireFormat.swift` (65.1% coverage)

2. **Enhance Documentation**
   - Add more detailed examples to API documentation
   - Update serialization documentation with complex examples
   - Ensure all public APIs are properly documented

## Sprint 4 Planning

Sprint 4 will focus on "Complete Wire Format Implementation" with the following key deliverables:

1. **String Field Support**
   - Implement serialization/deserialization for string fields
   - Add UTF-8 validation
   - Create tests for various string scenarios (empty, Unicode, etc.)

2. **Nested Message Support**
   - Implement serialization/deserialization for nested message fields
   - Add support for recursive message structures
   - Create tests for various nesting scenarios

3. **Fixed-Length Field Support**
   - Implement serialization/deserialization for fixed32 and fixed64 fields
   - Add support for sfixed32 and sfixed64 fields
   - Create tests for fixed-length fields

4. **Bytes Field Support**
   - Implement serialization/deserialization for bytes fields
   - Add support for large byte arrays
   - Create tests for various bytes scenarios

5. **Enum Support**
   - Implement serialization/deserialization for enum fields
   - Add support for unknown enum values
   - Create tests for enum fields

## Transition Plan

1. **Week 1 (Sprint 3 Closure)**
   - Complete remaining Sprint 3 tasks
   - Conduct Sprint 3 retrospective
   - Finalize Sprint 4 planning

2. **Week 2-3 (Sprint 4 Execution)**
   - Implement string and bytes field support
   - Implement nested message support
   - Implement fixed-length field support
   - Implement enum support

3. **Week 4 (Sprint 4 Closure)**
   - Complete testing and documentation
   - Conduct code reviews
   - Prepare for Sprint 5

## Key Performance Indicators

1. **Code Coverage**: Achieve 90% test coverage for all new code
2. **Performance**: Maintain performance within 40% of SwiftProtobuf
3. **API Usability**: Ensure all new APIs follow the established patterns
4. **Documentation**: Provide comprehensive documentation with examples for all new features
