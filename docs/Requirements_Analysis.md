     - Failed to marshal message
     - Basic map functionality not working
   - Required:
     - Fix map field type handling
     - Ensure proper map field serialization
     - Handle empty map fields correctly

   - Test: `testNestedMessageSerialization`
   - Issue: Failed to get states
   - Required:
     - Fix nested message serialization
     - Ensure proper state preservation
     - Handle deep nesting correctly

2. Large message handling

   - Issue: Failed to get repeated field values
   - Required:
     - Handle large messages correctly
     - Optimize performance for large messages
     - Ensure memory efficiency

3. Unknown fields
   - Test: `testUnknownFields`
   - Issue: Failed to unmarshal message with unknown fields
   - Required:
     - Preserve unknown fields during serialization
     - Handle unknown fields during deserialization

## Performance

### ✅ Implemented Requirements
1. Basic performance tests pass
   - Test: `testPerformanceSerialization`
   - Test: `testPerformanceDeserialization`
   - Tests complete successfully

### ❌ Needs Implementation
1. Performance stability
   - Issues:
     - High relative standard deviation in serialization (39.414%)
     - High relative standard deviation in deserialization (95.915%)
     - Exceeds maximum allowed deviation (10%)
   - Required:
     - Optimize serialization stability
     - Optimize deserialization stability
     - Reduce performance variability

## Implementation Priority

Based on test failures and dependencies, here's the recommended implementation order:

1. **High Priority**
   - Primitive types support (foundation for other features)
   - Repeated fields support (most common failure)
   - Field validation (prevents invalid states)
   - Performance stability (high deviation in core operations)

2. **Medium Priority**
   - Map fields support (including basic operations)
   - Nested message serialization
   - Enum field serialization
   - Empty repeated fields handling

3. **Low Priority**
   - Unknown fields handling
   - Large message optimization

## Technical Requirements

### Wire Format
- Use length-delimited format for messages
- Properly encode field numbers and wire types
- Handle all Protocol Buffer wire types correctly

### Type Safety
- Implement strict type checking
- Validate field types during serialization
- Handle type mismatches gracefully

### Memory Management
- Ensure proper memory handling for large messages
- Avoid unnecessary copying
- Handle circular references correctly

### Performance
- Maintain consistent serialization performance
- Maintain consistent deserialization performance
- Keep performance deviation under 10%
- Optimize memory allocations

### Error Handling
- Provide clear error messages
- Handle edge cases gracefully
- Maintain data integrity during errors

## Next Steps

1. Start with fixing repeated fields implementation as it affects multiple tests
2. Review and fix primitive types serialization
3. Implement proper field validation
4. Optimize performance stability
5. Address map fields and nested messages
6. Add comprehensive error handling
