## Definition of Done

For Sprint 3 to be considered complete, the following criteria must be met:

1. All deliverables meet their acceptance criteria
2. All code follows the project's coding standards
3. All code is properly documented with inline comments and API documentation
4. All tests pass and meet the coverage requirements
5. The code has been reviewed by at least one other team member
6. The code has been merged into the main branch
7. The documentation has been updated to reflect the current state of the project
8. Performance benchmarks show acceptable performance compared to SwiftProtobuf

## Risk Management

The following risks have been identified for Sprint 3:

1. **Performance Concerns**: Wire format operations are performance-critical and may be challenging to optimize.
   - Mitigation: Implement early performance benchmarks, profile critical paths, and optimize incrementally.

2. **Compatibility with SwiftProtobuf**: Ensuring seamless integration with SwiftProtobuf's wire format implementation may be challenging.
   - Mitigation: Thoroughly study SwiftProtobuf's implementation, implement comprehensive interoperability tests, and prioritize compatibility over custom optimizations.

3. **Edge Cases in Binary Format**: The Protocol Buffer binary format has many edge cases that must be handled correctly.
   - Mitigation: Implement comprehensive test cases covering all edge cases documented in the Protocol Buffer specification.

4. **Large Message Handling**: Handling large messages efficiently may be challenging.
   - Mitigation: Implement incremental processing where possible and test with messages of various sizes.

## Success Criteria

Sprint 3 will be considered successful if:

1. All tests pass with no regressions
2. All Definition of Done criteria are met
3. The library can serialize and deserialize dynamic messages with all supported primitive field types
4. Performance is within acceptable limits compared to SwiftProtobuf
5. The API is intuitive and well-documented
6. Interoperability with SwiftProtobuf is demonstrated

## Alignment with Product Vision

This sprint directly addresses Epic 2: Wire Format Serialization from the Product Discovery document, which focuses on leveraging SwiftProtobuf's wire format implementation for serialization and deserialization. By implementing these capabilities, we enable developers to:

1. Serialize dynamic messages to standard protobuf binary format
2. Deserialize protobuf binary data into dynamic messages
3. Handle all protobuf wire types supported by SwiftProtobuf

This sprint is a critical step toward our vision of providing a robust, performant, and developer-friendly solution for dynamic Protocol Buffer handling that builds directly on Apple's SwiftProtobuf library.

## Next Steps

Upon successful completion of Sprint 3, the team will:

1. Review the results and lessons learned
2. Refine the backlog for Sprint 4
3. Update the technical roadmap based on insights gained during Sprint 3
4. Begin planning for Sprint 4, which will focus on complete wire format implementation, including support for string fields, nested messages, and fixed-length fields
