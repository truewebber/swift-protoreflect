# SwiftProtoReflect Product Discovery Document

## Product Vision

SwiftProtoReflect aims to be the premier Swift library for dynamic Protocol Buffer handling, enabling developers to work with protobuf messages without pre-compiled schemas. Our vision is to provide a robust, performant, and developer-friendly solution that **builds directly on Apple's SwiftProtobuf library as our foundation**. Rather than creating parallel implementations, we extend SwiftProtobuf with dynamic capabilities while maintaining full compatibility with its static, generated code approach. This ensures developers can seamlessly combine static and dynamic handling in the same application.

## Market Opportunity

Protocol Buffers are widely used for serialization in distributed systems, microservices, and mobile applications. While Apple's SwiftProtobuf provides excellent support for static, code-generation based Protocol Buffers, there are several scenarios where a dynamic approach is beneficial:

1. **Dynamic API consumption**: When working with frequently changing APIs
2. **Exploratory development**: When prototyping or exploring new services
3. **Testing and debugging**: When needing to mock or manipulate messages
4. **Legacy system integration**: When documentation is incomplete or schemas are unavailable
5. **Hybrid approaches**: When needing to combine static and dynamic protobuf handling in the same application

SwiftProtoReflect addresses these pain points by **extending Apple's SwiftProtobuf with dynamic capabilities**, providing a seamless experience for developers already familiar with the SwiftProtobuf ecosystem.

## Scope Clarification

SwiftProtoReflect is focused specifically on:

1. **Core Dynamic Message Handling**: Creating and modifying Protocol Buffer objects dynamically based on descriptors
2. **SwiftProtobuf Integration**: Leveraging Apple's SwiftProtobuf for serialization/deserialization where possible
3. **Reflection Capabilities**: Providing introspection and manipulation of message structures at runtime

The library intentionally does not include:
- Framework-specific integrations (SwiftUI, Combine, etc.)
- Application-specific functionality
- Higher-level abstractions beyond dynamic message handling

These capabilities are better suited for separate libraries that build on top of SwiftProtoReflect.

## Conclusion

SwiftProtoReflect fills a significant gap in the Swift ecosystem by providing dynamic Protocol Buffer handling capabilities that build directly on Apple's SwiftProtobuf library. By extending SwiftProtobuf rather than creating a parallel implementation, we ensure seamless integration with the existing ecosystem while adding valuable dynamic capabilities.

Our approach acknowledges SwiftProtobuf as the foundation for Protocol Buffer handling in Swift and focuses on adding value through dynamic message handling, runtime reflection, and simplified APIs for common dynamic operations. This pragmatic approach ensures developers can leverage the best of both worlds: the type safety of generated code when appropriate, and the flexibility of dynamic handling when needed.

The library maintains a focused scope, concentrating on core dynamic message handling functionality without venturing into framework-specific integrations. This ensures that SwiftProtoReflect remains a solid foundation upon which other libraries and applications can build more specialized functionality.

The structured approach outlined in this document ensures we deliver a high-quality, production-ready library that meets real developer needs while maintaining full compatibility with the SwiftProtobuf ecosystem.
