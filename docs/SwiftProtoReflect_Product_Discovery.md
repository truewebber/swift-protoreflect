# SwiftProtoReflect Product Discovery Document

## Product Vision

SwiftProtoReflect aims to be the premier Swift library for dynamic Protocol Buffer handling, enabling developers to work with protobuf messages without pre-compiled schemas. Our vision is to provide a robust, performant, and developer-friendly solution that maintains wire format compatibility while offering the flexibility of runtime message definition and manipulation.

## Market Opportunity

Protocol Buffers are widely used for serialization in distributed systems, microservices, and mobile applications. However, traditional protobuf implementations require a compilation step that can be cumbersome in certain scenarios:

1. **Dynamic API consumption**: When working with frequently changing APIs
2. **Exploratory development**: When prototyping or exploring new services
3. **Testing and debugging**: When needing to mock or manipulate messages
4. **Legacy system integration**: When documentation is incomplete or schemas are unavailable

SwiftProtoReflect addresses these pain points by providing a dynamic, reflection-based approach to Protocol Buffers in Swift.

## Product Decomposition by Epics

### Epic 1: Core Message Handling Framework
**Goal**: Establish a robust foundation for dynamic protobuf message handling

#### User Stories:
1. As a developer, I need to define protobuf message structures at runtime so I can work without pre-compiled schemas
2. As a developer, I need to create and manipulate message instances dynamically so I can adapt to changing requirements
3. As a developer, I need to access field values in a type-safe manner so I can avoid runtime errors
4. As a developer, I need to validate message structures so I can ensure compatibility with protobuf specifications

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- Message descriptors must support all standard protobuf field types (int32, int64, uint32, uint64, string, bool, message, enum)
- Field access must be type-safe with appropriate error handling
- Message validation must verify field numbers, names, and types according to protobuf specifications
- API must be intuitive and consistent with Swift idioms
- 100% unit test coverage for core components
- Performance benchmarks must show acceptable overhead compared to compiled protobuf (within 30% for typical operations)

### Epic 2: Wire Format Serialization
**Goal**: Ensure full compatibility with protobuf binary wire format

#### User Stories:
1. As a developer, I need to serialize dynamic messages to standard protobuf binary format so I can communicate with existing protobuf systems
2. As a developer, I need to deserialize protobuf binary data into dynamic messages so I can process incoming protobuf messages

2. As a developer, I need to discover available fields in a message so I can work with unknown schemas
3. As a developer, I need to validate message instances against their descriptors so I can ensure correctness

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- Must provide methods to describe message structures in human-readable format
- Must support field discovery by name and number
- Must support traversal of nested message structures

### Epic 5: Performance Optimization
**Goal**: Ensure the library performs efficiently for production use

#### User Stories:
1. As a developer, I need efficient memory usage so my application doesn't consume excessive resources
2. As a developer, I need fast serialization/deserialization so my application remains responsive
3. As a developer, I need optimized field access so dynamic message handling doesn't become a bottleneck

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- Memory usage must not exceed 1.5x that of compiled protobuf for equivalent messages
- Serialization/deserialization must complete within 50ms for messages up to 1MB
- Field access performance must be within 25% of direct property access
