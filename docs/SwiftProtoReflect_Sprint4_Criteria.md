## Definition of Done

For Sprint 4 to be considered complete, the following criteria must be met:

1. All deliverables meet their acceptance criteria
   - All functional requirements have been implemented
   - Test coverage is at least 90%

2. All code follows the project's coding standards
   - Code follows Swift naming conventions
   - All linting issues have been fixed
   - Code organization is clean and logical

3. All code is properly documented with inline comments and API documentation
   - API documentation has been updated with new field type details
   - Inline comments explain complex logic
   - Examples have been provided for all new functionality

4. All tests pass and meet the coverage requirements
   - All tests pass successfully
   - Code coverage is at least 90%
   - Tests cover edge cases and error scenarios

5. The code has been merged into the main branch
   - All code has been merged into the main branch
   - No merge conflicts remain

6. The documentation has been updated to reflect the current state of the project
   - API documentation has been updated
   - Progress tracker has been updated
   - Detailed documentation has been created for all new functionality
   - Examples have been provided for all new functionality

7. Performance benchmarks show acceptable performance compared to SwiftProtobuf
   - Performance benchmarks show performance within 40% of SwiftProtobuf
   - Benchmarks have been implemented for all new operations

## Risk Management

### Identified Risks

1. **Complexity of Nested Messages**: Handling deeply nested message structures may introduce unexpected challenges.
   - **Mitigation**: Start with simple nesting and incrementally add complexity. Create thorough tests for each level of nesting.

2. **Performance of String/Bytes Fields**: Large string or bytes fields may impact performance.
   - **Mitigation**: Implement benchmarks early and optimize as needed. Consider chunked processing for large fields.

3. **UTF-8 Validation**: Proper UTF-8 validation can be complex and impact performance.
   - **Mitigation**: Research best practices for UTF-8 validation in Swift. Consider using existing libraries if appropriate.

4. **Recursive Message Structures**: Handling recursive message structures may lead to stack overflow or memory issues.
   - **Mitigation**: Implement depth limits and test with various recursive structures. Consider iterative approaches instead of recursive ones.

### Contingency Plans

1. If performance issues arise, prioritize correctness over performance for the initial implementation, then optimize in a subsequent sprint.
2. If time constraints become an issue, prioritize the most commonly used field types (string, nested messages) and defer less common types to the next sprint.
3. If technical challenges prove more difficult than anticipated, consider breaking down the work into smaller, more manageable tasks.

## Next Steps

1. Refine the backlog for Sprint 4
2. Assign tasks to team members
3. Set up daily stand-ups to track progress
4. Begin implementation of string field support as the first priority
