# SwiftProtoReflect Testing Strategy

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the SwiftProtoReflect library, ensuring that it meets all functional requirements, performance goals, and quality standards.

## Testing Principles

1. **Test-Driven Development**: Tests will be written before implementation to guide the development process.
2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: We aim for at least 90% code coverage across the library.
3. **Realistic Scenarios**: Tests will include real-world usage patterns and edge cases.
4. **Performance Awareness**: Performance benchmarks will be included to ensure the library meets performance goals.
5. **Integration Focus**: Tests will verify seamless integration with Apple's SwiftProtobuf library.

## Test Types

### Unit Testing

Unit tests focus on testing individual components in isolation to ensure they function correctly.

#### Descriptor Wrapper Tests

- **MessageDescriptor Tests**
  - Initialization from SwiftProtobuf descriptors
  - Access to message properties (name, full name)
  - Field lookup by name and number
  - Nested type access
  - Validation logic

- **FieldDescriptor Tests**
  - Initialization from SwiftProtobuf descriptors
  - Access to field properties (name, number, type)
  - Type identification (repeated, map, required)
  - Default value handling
  - Validation logic

- **EnumDescriptor Tests**
  - Initialization from SwiftProtobuf descriptors
  - Access to enum properties (name, full name)
  - Value lookup by name and number
  - Validation logic

- **OneofDescriptor Tests**
  - Initialization from SwiftProtobuf descriptors
  - Access to oneof properties (name)
  - Field access within oneof
  - Validation logic

#### Descriptor Registry Tests

- Registration of file descriptors
- Lookup of message and enum descriptors
- Handling of dependencies between descriptors
- Thread safety
- Error handling

#### DynamicMessage Tests

- Initialization from descriptors
- Getting and setting field values
- Validation of field values
- Handling of different field types

## Test Data Strategy

### Test Proto Files

We will create a set of test .proto files that cover various Protocol Buffer features:

1. **Basic Types**: A proto file with all basic field types
2. **Nested Messages**: A proto file with nested message definitions
3. **Enums**: A proto file with enum definitions
4. **Repeated Fields**: A proto file with repeated fields
5. **Map Fields**: A proto file with map fields
6. **Oneofs**: A proto file with oneof fields
7. **Extensions**: A proto file with extensions
8. **Options**: A proto file with various options
9. **Services**: A proto file with service definitions
10. **Complex Schema**: A proto file with a complex schema combining multiple features

### Test Data Generation

We will generate test data for each test proto file:

1. **Generated Swift Code**: Using protoc with the SwiftProtobuf plugin
2. **Binary Test Data**: Sample binary-encoded messages
3. **JSON Test Data**: Sample JSON-encoded messages
4. **Text Format Test Data**: Sample text format-encoded messages

### Test Utilities

We will create test utilities to facilitate testing:

1. **Message Comparison**: Utilities for comparing messages for equality
2. **Test Data Loading**: Utilities for loading test data from files
3. **Random Message Generation**: Utilities for generating random messages
4. **Performance Measurement**: Utilities for measuring performance

## Continuous Integration

We will set up a continuous integration pipeline that:

1. Runs all tests on every commit
2. Measures code coverage
3. Runs performance benchmarks
4. Performs static analysis
5. Verifies documentation

## Test Documentation

We will document our tests to ensure they are maintainable and understandable:

1. **Test Plan**: A document describing the overall test strategy
2. **Test Cases**: Documentation for each test case, including purpose and expected results
3. **Test Data**: Documentation for test data, including how it was generated
4. **Test Results**: Regular reports on test results and coverage

## Conclusion

This testing strategy ensures that SwiftProtoReflect will be a high-quality, reliable library that meets all functional requirements, performance goals, and quality standards. By following this strategy, we will deliver a library that integrates seamlessly with Apple's SwiftProtobuf library while providing powerful dynamic message handling capabilities.
