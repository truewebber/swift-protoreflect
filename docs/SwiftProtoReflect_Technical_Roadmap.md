# SwiftProtoReflect Technical Roadmap

## Overview

This technical roadmap outlines the development approach for SwiftProtoReflect, a dynamic Protocol Buffer handling library for Swift. The roadmap is designed to systematically build the library's capabilities while ensuring all acceptance criteria are met through comprehensive testing.

## Core Development Principles

1. **Test-Driven Development**: Every feature will be developed using TDD principles, with tests written before implementation.
2. **Continuous Integration**: All code will be continuously integrated and tested to catch regressions early.
3. **Incremental Delivery**: Features will be built incrementally, with each increment providing tangible value.
4. **Performance Benchmarking**: Performance will be measured continuously against established baselines.
5. **Documentation-as-Code**: Documentation will be treated as a first-class deliverable, developed alongside code.

## Technical Debt Management

To prevent accumulation of technical debt, we will:

1. Maintain a minimum of 90% code coverage
2. Perform regular code reviews
3. Refactor code as needed during development
4. Address performance issues as they are identified
5. Document design decisions and trade-offs

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Performance below target | High | Medium | Early and continuous performance testing, optimization sprints |
| Compatibility issues with protoc | High | Medium | Comprehensive interoperability testing, wire format compliance checks |
| Memory leaks in complex scenarios | Medium | Low | Memory profiling, leak detection in CI |
| API design limitations discovered late | High | Medium | Early prototyping, incremental API reviews |
| Swift language evolution impacts | Medium | Low | Monitoring Swift evolution, defensive API design |

## Conclusion

This technical roadmap provides a structured approach to developing SwiftProtoReflect, ensuring that all acceptance criteria are met through comprehensive testing. By following this roadmap, we will deliver a high-quality, performant, and developer-friendly library for dynamic Protocol Buffer handling in Swift.
