# SwiftProtoReflect Technical Roadmap

This document outlines the technical roadmap for the SwiftProtoReflect library, a dynamic Protocol Buffer handling library for Swift that builds directly on Apple's SwiftProtobuf library.

## Overview

SwiftProtoReflect extends Apple's SwiftProtobuf library with dynamic message handling capabilities. Rather than creating parallel implementations of Protocol Buffer concepts, we build directly on SwiftProtobuf's types and wire format implementation.

The roadmap is organized into phases, each building on the previous to deliver a complete, production-ready library.

## Core Development Principles

1. **Test-Driven Development**: Every feature will be developed using TDD principles, with tests written before implementation to ensure correctness and guide the design.

2. **Continuous Integration**: All code will be continuously integrated and tested to catch regressions early and maintain high quality throughout development.

3. **Incremental Delivery**: Features will be built incrementally, with each increment providing tangible value and building toward the complete solution.

4. **Performance Benchmarking**: Performance will be measured continuously against established baselines and direct SwiftProtobuf usage to ensure the library meets performance goals.

5. **Documentation-as-Code**: Documentation will be treated as a first-class deliverable, developed alongside code and kept in sync with implementation.

6. **SwiftProtobuf Integration**: All components will be designed to integrate seamlessly with SwiftProtobuf's types and APIs, leveraging existing functionality rather than duplicating it.

7. **API Consistency**: The API will follow Swift idioms and conventions, providing a consistent and intuitive interface that feels natural to Swift developers.

8. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling will be implemented throughout the library, with clear, actionable error messages to aid debugging.

9. **Memory Efficiency**: The library will be designed with memory efficiency in mind, particularly for large messages and high-throughput scenarios.

10. **Cross-Platform Support**: The library will support all Apple platforms (iOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS) with a consistent API and behavior.

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Sprint 1)
