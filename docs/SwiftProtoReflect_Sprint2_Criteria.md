# SwiftProtoReflect Sprint 2 Acceptance Criteria

This document outlines the acceptance criteria for Sprint 2 of the SwiftProtoReflect project, focusing on dynamic message implementation and field access capabilities.

## Sprint 2 Goal

- [x] Supports string and bytes types
- [x] Supports message types (nested messages)
- [x] Supports enum types
- [x] Supports repeated fields (arrays)
- [x] Supports map fields (dictionaries)
- [x] Provides type-safe access methods for all supported types
- [x] Implements proper equality and hashing
- [x] Validates values against field descriptors
- [x] Includes proper documentation with examples

### 2. Dynamic Message Implementation

An enhanced implementation of the `ProtoDynamicMessage` class for creating and manipulating Protocol Buffer messages dynamically.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Supports creation from a message descriptor

### 3. Field Access

A set of utilities for accessing fields in dynamic messages, including support for field paths and type-safe access.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Supports accessing fields by name
- [x] Supports accessing fields by number
- [x] Supports accessing nested fields using path notation (e.g., "person.address.street")
- [x] Provides type-safe access methods for all supported types
- [x] Handles repeated fields with index-based access
- [x] Handles map fields with key-based access
- [x] Validates field access against descriptors
- [x] Includes proper error handling for invalid access
- [x] Includes proper documentation with examples

### 4. Facade API

A high-level API for working with dynamic Protocol Buffer messages, providing a simple and intuitive interface for common operations.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Provides a simple interface for creating dynamic messages
- [x] Supports descriptor lookup and registration
- [x] Implements a builder pattern for message creation
- [x] Implements a fluent interface for field access
- [x] Supports serialization and deserialization
- [x] Handles errors gracefully with meaningful error messages
- [x] Includes proper documentation with examples

**Completed Refactoring Tasks:**
- [x] Extract `MessageBuilder` class to its own file
- [x] Maintain the same public API
- [x] Ensure proper encapsulation
- [x] Maintain proper documentation
- [x] Ensure the `ProtoReflect` class is thinner

### 5. Test Suite Expansion

An expanded test suite covering all new functionality.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Includes unit tests for all new components
- [x] Includes integration tests for the facade API
- [x] Tests all supported field types
- [x] Tests nested messages, repeated fields, and map fields
- [x] Tests error conditions and edge cases
- [x] Achieves at least 90% code coverage
- [x] Includes performance benchmarks for key operations

## Definition of Done

For Sprint 2 to be considered complete, the following criteria must be met:

1. All deliverables meet their acceptance criteria ✅
2. All code follows the project's coding standards ✅
3. All code is properly documented with inline comments and API documentation ✅
4. All tests pass and meet the coverage requirements ✅
5. The code has been reviewed by at least one other team member ✅
6. The code has been merged into the main branch ✅
7. The documentation has been updated to reflect the current state of the project ✅
8. Performance benchmarks show acceptable performance compared to generated code ✅

## Risk Management

The following risks have been identified for Sprint 2:

1. **Complex Type Handling**: Handling all Protocol Buffer types correctly, especially nested messages and maps, may be challenging.
   - Mitigation: Implement thorough testing with complex message structures and carefully implement type conversion.
   - **Status**: Successfully addressed with comprehensive test suite covering all types and edge cases.

2. **Performance Concerns**: Dynamic message handling could be slower than generated code.
   - Mitigation: Implement caching, optimize field access, and benchmark against generated code.
   - **Status**: Performance benchmarks show acceptable performance for all operations.

3. **API Usability**: The API might be too complex or unintuitive for users.
   - Mitigation: Design with developer experience in mind, create usage examples, and get early feedback.
   - **Status**: Successfully addressed with a clean, intuitive API and comprehensive documentation.

4. **Memory Management**: Potential memory leaks with circular references in nested messages.
   - Mitigation: Implement careful reference management, memory profiling, and use weak references where appropriate.
   - **Status**: Successfully addressed with proper reference management and thorough testing.

## Success Criteria

Sprint 2 will be considered successful if:

1. All tests pass with no regressions ✅
2. All Definition of Done criteria are met ✅
3. The library can create, manipulate, and serialize/deserialize dynamic messages with all supported field types ✅
4. Performance is within acceptable limits compared to generated code ✅
5. The API is intuitive and well-documented ✅

## Next Steps

Upon successful completion of Sprint 2, the team will:

1. Review the results and lessons learned
2. Refine the backlog for Sprint 3
3. Update the technical roadmap based on insights gained during Sprint 2
4. Begin planning for Sprint 3, which will focus on basic wire format implementation
