# SwiftProtoReflect Sprint 1 Acceptance Criteria

This document outlines the acceptance criteria for Sprint 1 of the SwiftProtoReflect project, focusing on the core infrastructure and descriptor handling capabilities.

## Sprint 1 Goal

Establish the core infrastructure for dynamic Protocol Buffer handling by implementing descriptor wrappers and basic message handling capabilities that integrate with Apple's SwiftProtobuf library.

## Deliverables

- [x] Implements initialization from a SwiftProtobuf descriptor
- [x] Provides access to message name and full name
- [x] Provides access to fields through a typed array
- [x] Supports lookup of fields by name and number
- [x] Provides access to nested types and enum types
- [x] Includes proper documentation with examples

#### FieldDescriptor

A wrapper class for SwiftProtobuf's `Google_Protobuf_FieldDescriptorProto` that provides a more convenient API for working with field descriptors.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Implements initialization from a SwiftProtobuf descriptor
- [x] Provides access to field name, number, and type
- [x] Correctly identifies repeated, required, and optional fields
- [x] Correctly identifies map fields and provides access to key and value types
- [x] Provides access to default values when specified
- [x] Supports validation of field values
- [x] Includes proper documentation with examples

#### EnumDescriptor

A wrapper class for SwiftProtobuf's `Google_Protobuf_EnumDescriptorProto` that provides a more convenient API for working with enum descriptors.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Implements initialization from a SwiftProtobuf descriptor
- [x] Provides access to enum name and full name
- [x] Provides access to enum values through a typed array
- [x] Supports lookup of enum values by name and number
- [x] Includes proper documentation with examples

#### OneofDescriptor

A wrapper class for SwiftProtobuf's `Google_Protobuf_OneofDescriptorProto` that provides a more convenient API for working with oneof descriptors.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Implements initialization from a SwiftProtobuf descriptor
- [x] Provides access to oneof name
- [x] Provides access to fields within the oneof
- [x] Includes proper documentation with examples

### 2. Descriptor Registry

A registry for managing and accessing descriptors.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Supports registration of file descriptors
- [x] Supports lookup of message descriptors by fully qualified name
- [x] Supports lookup of enum descriptors by fully qualified name
- [x] Handles dependencies between descriptors correctly
- [x] Provides thread-safe access to descriptors
- [x] Includes proper documentation with examples

### 3. Basic DynamicMessage Implementation

A class for dynamically creating and manipulating Protocol Buffer messages based on descriptors.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Implements initialization from a MessageDescriptor
- [x] Supports getting and setting field values by name and number
- [x] Validates field values against their descriptors
- [x] Handles basic field types (int32, int64, uint32, uint64, float, double, bool, string, bytes)
- [x] Includes proper documentation with examples

### 4. Test Infrastructure

A comprehensive test suite for validating the functionality of the descriptor wrappers and dynamic message implementation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Includes unit tests for all descriptor wrapper classes
- [x] Includes unit tests for the descriptor registry
- [x] Includes unit tests for the dynamic message implementation
- [x] Achieves at least 90% code coverage
- [x] Includes performance benchmarks for key operations

### 5. Test Data Strategy

A strategy for generating and managing test data for validating the library's functionality.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Defines a set of test .proto files covering various Protocol Buffer features
- [x] Includes a process for generating test data from the test .proto files
- [x] Provides utilities for comparing expected and actual results
- [x] Supports testing with both valid and invalid inputs
- [x] Includes documentation on how to extend the test data for future sprints

## Definition of Done

For Sprint 1 to be considered complete, the following criteria must be met:

1. All deliverables meet their acceptance criteria
2. All code follows the project's coding standards
3. All code is properly documented with inline comments and API documentation
4. All tests pass and meet the coverage requirements
5. The code has been reviewed by at least one other team member
6. The code has been merged into the main branch
7. The documentation has been updated to reflect the current state of the project

## Integration with SwiftProtobuf

A key aspect of Sprint 1 is ensuring proper integration with Apple's SwiftProtobuf library. This includes:

1. Using SwiftProtobuf's descriptor types as the foundation for our wrapper classes
2. Ensuring compatibility with SwiftProtobuf's wire format implementation
3. Validating that our dynamic message implementation can interoperate with SwiftProtobuf's generated code
4. Documenting best practices for using SwiftProtoReflect alongside SwiftProtobuf

## Risk Management

The following risks have been identified for Sprint 1:

1. **Complexity of Protocol Buffer Descriptors**: The Protocol Buffer descriptor format is complex and may require additional time to fully understand and implement.
   - Mitigation: Start with a simplified subset of features and expand incrementally.

2. **Integration with SwiftProtobuf**: Ensuring seamless integration with SwiftProtobuf may be challenging.
   - Mitigation: Begin with thorough analysis of SwiftProtobuf's implementation and design our API to complement it.

3. **Performance Concerns**: Dynamic message handling is inherently less efficient than generated code.
   - Mitigation: Implement performance benchmarks early and optimize critical paths.

4. **API Design Decisions**: Early API design decisions may impact future sprints.
   - Mitigation: Focus on a clean, extensible API design and be prepared to refactor if necessary.

## Next Steps

Upon successful completion of Sprint 1, the team will:

1. Review the results and lessons learned
2. Refine the backlog for Sprint 2
3. Update the technical roadmap based on insights gained during Sprint 1
4. Begin planning for Sprint 2, which will focus on serialization and deserialization capabilities
