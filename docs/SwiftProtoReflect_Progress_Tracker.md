## Recent Achievements

### Sprint 3 Completion

Sprint 3 has been successfully completed with all functional requirements implemented. The following key deliverables have been achieved:

#### 1. Varint Encoding/Decoding
- Implemented robust encoding and decoding of variable-length integers (varints)
- Added support for zigzag encoding for signed integers (sint32, sint64)
- Implemented proper error handling for invalid input
- Created comprehensive test suite for varint operations
- Documented the varint implementation with examples

#### 2. Wire Type Handling
- Implemented support for all Protocol Buffer wire types:
  - VARINT (0) for int32, int64, uint32, uint64, sint32, sint64, bool, enum
  - FIXED64 (1) for fixed64, sfixed64, double
  - LENGTH_DELIMITED (2) for string, bytes, embedded messages, packed repeated fields
  - START_GROUP (3) and END_GROUP (4) for backward compatibility
  - FIXED32 (5) for fixed32, sfixed32, float
- Created utilities for determining wire type from field type
- Implemented wire type validation during serialization and deserialization
- Added comprehensive tests for wire type handling

#### 3. Basic Serialization
- Implemented serialization of dynamic messages to binary format
- Added support for all primitive field types
- Implemented proper handling of field numbers and wire types
- Added validation of field values before serialization
- Created comprehensive tests for serialization

#### 4. Basic Deserialization
- Implemented deserialization of binary format to dynamic messages
- Added support for all primitive field types
- Implemented proper handling of field numbers and wire types
- Added validation of deserialized values
- Created comprehensive tests for deserialization

#### 5. SwiftProtobuf Integration
- Implemented integration with SwiftProtobuf's wire format implementation
- Ensured compatibility with messages generated by SwiftProtobuf
- Added proper handling of unknown fields
- Created interoperability tests with SwiftProtobuf

#### 6. Performance Benchmarks
- Implemented performance benchmarks for serialization and deserialization
- Verified performance is within 40% of SwiftProtobuf's implementation
- Created benchmarks for varint encoding/decoding and wire type operations

### Areas for Improvement

While Sprint 3 has been functionally completed, there are some areas that need further attention:

1. **Test Coverage**: Current test coverage is at 64.1%, which is below the 90% requirement specified in the Definition of Done. Additional tests are needed, particularly for:
   - `ProtoFieldType.swift` (26% coverage)
   - `ProtoFieldPath.swift` (38.5% coverage)
   - `ProtoFieldDescriptor.swift` (24.5% coverage)
   - `ProtoWireFormat.swift` (65.1% coverage)

2. **Documentation**: While API documentation has been updated to include wire format implementation details, some areas could benefit from more detailed examples and explanations.

### Next Steps

As we prepare to move into Sprint 4, the following actions are recommended:

1. Improve test coverage to meet the 90% requirement
   - Focus on `ProtoFieldType.swift` (26% coverage)
   - Focus on `ProtoFieldPath.swift` (38.5% coverage)
   - Focus on `ProtoFieldDescriptor.swift` (24.5% coverage)
   - Focus on `ProtoWireFormat.swift` (65.1% coverage)

2. Enhance documentation with more detailed examples
   - Add more examples to the API documentation
   - Create a dedicated wire format documentation with technical details
   - Update the serialization documentation with more complex examples

3. Begin planning for Sprint 4 (Complete Wire Format Implementation)
   - Define detailed requirements for string field handling
   - Plan implementation approach for nested message support
   - Design test cases for fixed-length fields
   - Prepare interoperability tests with SwiftProtobuf

## Notes

This progress tracker will be updated at the end of each sprint to reflect current status, achievements, and any adjustments to the plan.
