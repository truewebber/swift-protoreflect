# SwiftProtoReflect Developer Guide

## Important - Read This First!

**ATTENTION:** After each commit, you lose all memory of previous work. This document will help you quickly restore context and continue development.

## Workflow Considering Memory Loss

1. **First thing after returning to the project:**
   - Read PROJECT_STATE.md file to understand current status
   - Check "Active Tasks" and "Latest Updates" sections
   - Run `git log -5` to see what was done in recent commits

2. **Before starting work:**
   - Identify task from PROJECT_STATE.md
   - Study the structure of the corresponding module and its _README.md
   - Run tests to see what works
   - Check current test coverage (`make coverage`)

3. **During work:**
   - Comment code so your "future self" can understand the logic
   - Make small atomic changes
   - Update _README.md of the module you're working on
   - **Strive for maximum test coverage** - this is critically important for library quality
     - Current achievement: 94.37% (excellent!)
     - Target for new modules: 90%+ (close to 100%)
     - Exceptions allowed for paths with `fatalError` or other untestable conditions
   - Follow established design patterns for codebase consistency
   - Use Equatable for all core data types
   - Strictly type APIs, minimize use of Any where possible

4. **Before each commit (mandatory!):**
   - Update PROJECT_STATE.md, marking completed tasks
   - Run `make test && make coverage` and ensure all tests pass with sufficient coverage
   - Make detailed commit message with module prefix: `[Module] What was done - Why it was done this way - What's next`
   - Run `./Scripts/update-state.sh` after commit to update "Latest Updates" section

## General Development Principles

1. **API Design**
   - Create intuitive API
   - Use named parameters for improved readability
   - Prefer methods with explicit naming, avoid method overloads without clear distinctions
   - Document all public APIs with DocC comments

2. **Type Safety**
   - Maximize use of Swift's type system to prevent compile-time errors
   - Explicitly handle errors through throws/try
   - Limit use of force unwrapping (!) to cases where it's absolutely safe

3. **Performance**
   - Optimize critical code paths
   - Minimize data copying where possible
   - Use data structures appropriate for operation characteristics

4. **Testing**
   - Write tests in parallel with code, not after
   - Test edge cases and boundary conditions
   - Create tests that verify not only functionality but also correct error handling

## Code Conventions

- Follow Swift code style from neighboring files
- Use DocC format documentation with /// for public API
- Add tests for each new functionality
- **High test coverage required** - use `make coverage` for verification
  - Unreachable paths (e.g., with `fatalError`) may be excluded from 100% coverage requirement
  - Important: add comment explaining why specific path is not covered by tests

## Testing and Error Handling

### Test Structure

Each test file should contain:
1. **Initialization tests** - verify correct object initialization with different parameters
2. **Main functionality tests** - verify core functions and methods
3. **Boundary condition tests** - verify behavior in edge cases
4. **Error tests** - verify correct error throwing
5. **Performance tests** (optional) - for critical code paths

### Testing Critical Failures

Some functions use `fatalError()` to handle invalid states that shouldn't occur during normal operation. These paths are difficult or impossible to test with standard means.

Examples of untestable code paths:
- Checking presence of required parameters in constructors
- Validating types that should have corresponding type names
- Checking structural integrity of composite objects

For such paths:
1. Add clear comment explaining why `fatalError` occurs
2. Use tests to verify correct usage cases
3. Use special expectations (XCTExpectFailure) where applicable

### Code Coverage Requirements

The established minimum code coverage threshold is 90%. For critically important components, strive for coverage close to 100%.

Use the following commands to check coverage:
```bash
make coverage      # General coverage report
```

## Useful Commands

```bash
# Status checking
git log -5                      # Last 5 commits
git diff HEAD~1                 # What changed in last commit

# Development
make lint                       # Code checking
make format                     # Code formatting
swift test                      # Run tests
make coverage                   # Check test coverage

# Creating new components
./Scripts/setup-module.sh Integration StructHandler  # Creates component file templates

# State updates
./Scripts/update-state.sh       # Update PROJECT_STATE.md
```

## Creating New Components

To quickly create file templates for new components, use the script:

```bash
./Scripts/setup-module.sh <Module Name> <Component Name>
```

The script automatically:
- Creates .swift component file with code template in corresponding module
- Creates test file for the component
- Updates module's _README.md, adding new component to the list
- Reminds to update PROJECT_STATE.md and make commit

Example:
```bash
./Scripts/setup-module.sh Integration StructHandler
```
